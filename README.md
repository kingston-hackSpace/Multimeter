# Multimeter

A multimeter is an instrument for measuring **voltage, current or resistance for low voltage projects** (up to 12V).

At our hackSpace, we use the [RS Multimeter model](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/multimeters/1231938)

# Warning!

⚠️  DO NOT USE IT ON MAINS ELECTRICITY (wall sockets)

It is safe to test Arduino circuits, LEDs, sensors, and batteries, but using it on household mains can be extremely dangerous.

----
# When to use it

We will mostly use it to troubleshoot problems with our circuit, such as:

- Check if a component is receiving power

- Test if wires or connections are continuous

- Detect short circuits before they cause damage

- Measure voltage or current from batteries, unusual power sources, or sensors
